## Abstract

*XXX*

## Replication

We provide all the functions needed to replicate our workflow in the "functions" folder.

### Data

#### Generated data

The "dataset" folder contains the data produced in this study. 

* `XXX`   

#### Secondary data

XXX

### Functions

The "functions" folder contains all the custom functions coded for the analysis.
They are all sourced from the `.R`, `.pdf` and `.Rmd` files and therefore the 
user of the code does not need to source them separately.

### Code

We offer the code in `.R`, `.pdf` and `.Rmd`. There are two main analyses:

* `code_XXX`: XXX

Our entire workflow can be run and the 
results replicated from either of these files. The user must run the code from the 
same folder where the files in the generated data section are stored for a successful 
compilation.
